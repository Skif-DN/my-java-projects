## 🎯 Why This Matters
- This repository demonstrates my progress in learning **Java**.  
- I started with simple console applications and gradually moved toward more complex projects:  
  **Console apps → Database integration → Web apps (Spring Boot, REST API).**  
- Each project reflects my growth and readiness for **Junior Java Developer** roles.

## 📌 Next Steps
- Add more projects:
  - Book Management App
  - Weather App (API-based)
  - REST API for a small online shop
- Learn and apply **Spring Boot, JUnit, Maven, SQL**.
